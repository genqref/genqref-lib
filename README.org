genrqref-lib is a batteries-included API Wrapper for the great [[https://spacetraders.io/][Space
Traders API]] in Clojure.

It is based on [[https://github.com/oliyh/martian][Martian]] (the HTTP abstraction library for
Clojure/script, supporting OpenAPI, Swagger, Schema, re-frame and
more). In order to minimize the number requests it supports a local
cache persisted through a [[https://github.com/jimpil/duratom][duratom]].

* Introduction

#+begin_src clojure
  (require '[genqref-lib.api :refer :all])

  ;; First you need to register a new agent

  (register! {:faction "COSMIC"
              :symbol "EXAMPLE-BOB"
              :email "bob@example.com"})

  ;; This will register a new agent and initialize the api for
  ;; authorized calls. Additionally this will create a local file
  ;; `tokens.edn` which holds your tokens. On subsequent runs you can
  ;; initialize the api with the token for the current run by calling

  (init!)

  ;; The registration did also populate the state (local cache) with
  ;; initial details. See you got some credits already

  (-> @state :agent :credits) ;; => 100000

  ;; `@state` is just a deeply nested map which holds all the data
  ;; retrieved from the API. This is helpful, as the API is
  ;; rate-limited. Here is your first ship

  (def ship (-> @state :ships vals first))

  ;; Your ship is located at a waypoint

  (def waypoint (-> ship :nav :waypointSymbol))

  ;; Technically this is not the waypoint. It's the waypoint's symbol.
  ;; Let's fix that by requesting more information from the API

  (def waypoint (refresh! :waypoint waypoint))

  ;; This will of course update `@state`, but fro convenience it also
  ;; returns the payload of the request. There are a couple more points
  ;; to note here: Outdated or missing information can be "refreshed" by
  ;; calling `refresh!`. All functions in genqref-lib that end in an
  ;; exclamation mark will perform one (or more, but usually one)
  ;; request against the API. `refresh!` reads information from the API
  ;; and updates the local state. For convenience in genqref-lib entity
  ;; maps like the waypoint we just received can be used interchangibly
  ;; with its symbol (ST-symbol, not Clojure symbol) in all function
  ;; calls. So the following two calls both work and yield the same
  ;; result.

  (refresh! :waypoint waypoint)
  (refresh! :waypoint (:symbol waypoint))

  ;; This comes in handy when exploring ST from the repl as you can
  ;; simply cut and paste the string identifiers and use them in
  ;; function calls.
